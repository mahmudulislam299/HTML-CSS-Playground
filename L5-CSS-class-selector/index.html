		<h1>Get ready for IoT networking chaos</h1>
		
		<div class="error">I am an error</div>

			<p>
				The sheer number of connectivity options available for 
				IoT networks will create chaos in the coming year, 
				according to a newly released  set of predictions 
				from Forrester Research.

			<p class="error">
				As there’s no single connectivity option that meets every 
				use case for IoT, businesses should expect to navigate a 
				landscape that includes proprietary low-power options like 
				Zigbee, unlicensed standards like Bluetooth, both public 
				and private varieties of 5G, Wi-Fi, and even satellite in 
				order to make deployments work.
			</p>

			<p class="success">
				2021 will actually see uptake rates for 5G and Wi-Fi slow 
				substantially as a result of the disjointed IoT connectivity 
				market, and some of that spending will go to satellite and 
				other low-power options, which should see 20% more interest 
				next year, Forrester says in “Predictions 2021: Internet Of 
				Things (IoT)”.
			</p>

			<p class="success feedback">
				Much of that interest--which, presumably, translates into 
				usage and sales--could be in the healthcare market, as the 
				spread of COVID-19 prompted substantial investment increases 
				in digital and remote health technology, according to the 
				analysts. Wearables and remote sensors to assess patients’ 
				health at home are suddenly more relevant than ever thanks 
				to the pandemic. Consumer interest is on the rise thanks to 
				the convenience factor, and insurers like the ability to have 
				additional data about their patients and their possible outcomes, 
				according to Forrester.
			</p>

			<p>
				Elsewhere, while the overall use of office space seems set to 
				remain historically low--more fallout from the pandemic--companies 
				that do plan to return to their offices in the anticipation of 
				COVID-19 levels eventually dropping could implement a lot of IoT 
				applications to keep employees safe and improve efficiency. Forrester 
				cites smart lighting, environmental monitoring, sensor-based activity 
				monitoring, and space-utilization systems as potential smart office 
				use cases for IoT.
			</p>

			<p>
				Finally, 2021 is the year when connected machines cross into 
				the mainstream of industrial use. While connected machinery 
				has been around for a long time, Forrester said that, until 
				recently, many users have been reluctant to use those connected 
				devices to their fullest capability. Once again, COVID-19 has 
				prompted change.

				The more in-depth models of industrial IoT use, like predictive maintenance 
				and business-as-a-service, will follow in widespread uptake as the basic 
				connectivity becomes more and more common, Forrester said.
